title: Letter Tile Possibilities

description:
You have n  tiles, where each tile has one letter tiles[i] printed on it.

Return the number of possible non-empty sequences of letters you can make using the letters printed on those tiles.



Example 1:

Input: tiles = "AAB"
Output: 8
Explanation: The possible sequences are "A", "B", "AA", "AB", "BA", "AAB", "ABA", "BAA".
Example 2:

Input: tiles = "AAABBC"
Output: 188
Example 3:

Input: tiles = "V"
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= tiles.length <= 7
tiles consists of uppercase English letters.
