title: Count of Substrings Containing Every Vowel and K Consonants II

description:
You are given a string word and a non-negative integer k.

Return the total number of substrings of word that contain every vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u') at least once and exactly k consonants.

 

Example 1:

Input: word = "aeioqq", k = 1

Output: 0

Explanation:

There is no substring with every vowel.

Example 2:

Input: word = "aeiou", k = 0

Output: 1

Explanation:

The only substring with every vowel and zero consonants is word[0..4], which is "aeiou".

Example 3:

Input: word = "ieaouqqieaouqq", k = 1

Output: 3

Explanation:

The substrings with every vowel and one consonant are:

word[0..5], which is "ieaouq".
word[6..11], which is "qieaou".
word[7..12], which is "ieaouq".
 

Constraints:

5 <= word.length <= 2 * 105
word consists only of lowercase English letters.
0 <= k <= word.length - 5
