title: Count the Number of Ideal Arrays

description:
You are given two integers n and maxValue, which are used to describe an ideal array.

A 0-indexed integer array arr of length n is considered ideal if the following conditions hold:

Every arr[i] is a value from 1 to maxValue, for 0 <= i < n.
Every arr[i] is divisible by arr[i - 1], for 0 < i < n.
Return the number of distinct ideal arrays of length n. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2, maxValue = 5
Output: 10
Explanation: The following are the possible ideal arrays:
- Arrays starting with the value 1 (5 arrays): [1,1], [1,2], [1,3], [1,4], [1,5]
- Arrays starting with the value 2 (2 arrays): [2,2], [2,4]
- Arrays starting with the value 3 (1 array): [3,3]
- Arrays starting with the value 4 (1 array): [4,4]
- Arrays starting with the value 5 (1 array): [5,5]
There are a total of 5 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10 distinct ideal arrays.
Example 2:

Input: n = 5, maxValue = 3
Output: 11
Explanation: The following are the possible ideal arrays:
- Arrays starting with the value 1 (9 arrays): 
   - With no other distinct values (1 array): [1,1,1,1,1] 
   - With 2nd distinct value 2 (4 arrays): [1,1,1,1,2], [1,1,1,2,2], [1,1,2,2,2], [1,2,2,2,2]
   - With 2nd distinct value 3 (4 arrays): [1,1,1,1,3], [1,1,1,3,3], [1,1,3,3,3], [1,3,3,3,3]
- Arrays starting with the value 2 (1 array): [2,2,2,2,2]
- Arrays starting with the value 3 (1 array): [3,3,3,3,3]
There are a total of 9 + 1 + 1 = 11 distinct ideal arrays.
 

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 104
1 <= maxValue <= 104
